Popular design patterns in typescript


**Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Often used in logging, database connections, and configuration settings.

**Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It’s useful for decoupling the client code from the object creation process.

**Abstract Factory Pattern:** A super-factory that creates other factories. It’s used when your system needs to create a family of related or dependent objects.

**Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It’s commonly used in constructing objects with multiple optional parameters.

**Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

**Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It's useful for event handling systems.

**Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It's used to reduce dependencies between the client code and the subsystem, making the code easier to maintain.

**Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.

**Decorator Pattern:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It’s often used in the context of adding responsibilities to objects.

**Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It's useful for implementing lazy initialization, access control, logging, and more.

**Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

**Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

**State Pattern:** Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

**Mediator Pattern:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

These patterns are commonly used in backend development, especially when dealing with system architecture, object creation, and interaction between different components. Make sure to understand their implementations, use cases, and potential pitfalls.
